But then again, you just need one influential VC fund to get on board, and you'll see the rest falling in. \n\nIf you don't already have startup-centric ESOPs, I've done a few ESOPs for non-startups, which I think I can retrofit for startups (may need to discuss this with you a bit), ",

        "text": "oh, and while I'm at it, I was also minded to ask if legalese is open to offering deal term surveys \/ reports, and I'm thinking out loud below: \n\nI think that a major challenge for entrepreneurs in fundraising, esp the inexperienced ones, is the fact that they may not have a good grasp of what's \"market\", and what deal terms are fair and usual. Experienced entrepreneurs would know how the game is played, and would know the terms from personal experience, or from knowing who to ask. VCs and business angels already talk among themselves. But inexperienced entrepreneurs can only rely on hearsay, and luck (having friends who had recently successfully closed a funding round), or to pay lawyers. \n\nIn a way, the safe, series seed docs etc. do a lot to prescribe balanced and fair terms, but these are usually more for the seed and seed plus stages, and these recommended terms are often prescriptive, whereas many seed plus funds and VCs tend to stick to their set of terms (or amend the safe heavily so much so that they are safes only in name). Although startups ask for free templates, I think what they really need is also this, and the more savvy ones often ask me if something is \"market\" and fair. \n\nWhat legalese does in publishing deal terms surveys is to build the brand and generate goodwill, establish thought leadership in the startup fundraising space, and \"give back\" to the space, in each of the markets that the deal terms survey(s) cover. I don't think anyone in the legaltech space does this (or anyone outside the US), and I think only silicon valley law firms and some silicon valley VC funds publish deal terms surveys \/ reports. \n\nI was initially thinking of the analytics element of the data, and how this would be very valuable data that VCs and other key stakeholders may pay for, sorta like merger market, but I reckon that there're either already existing services for this, the VCs already have this data or have access to it, or the revenue is not so much that we wanna give up the above benefits.\n\nA key legal concern may be that our target contributors of the deal terms data are bound by confidentiality obligations, but I think that by carefully anonymising the data, and giving them other assurances of our discretion, that concern is assuaged. \n\nThe other thing I wonder if this may achieve is that it may allow legalese to help set standards, and open up public access to such key data in Singapore. Based on the fact that there isn't a series seed or safe equivalent that originated here (we only have localised versions), I don't think anyone else would provide this. I'm hoping this doesn't piss the VCs off, by breaking some unwritten rule (like giving away the magician's secrets) but rather, an invitation for them to participate, and which provides them a platform to show that they are cool, transparent guys that startups can trust. \n\nWhat do you think, Meng? I hope I'm not completely missing the point here. Before I met you guys, I was trying to put together a deal terms survey, but I met with quite a bit of resistance, because not that many people dare to share deal terms, and even less so with a lawyer who hasn't represented them before.",

I know you've been plugging away at it for quite a long time now.\n\nA few weeks back, you signed up at <http:\/\/www.legalese.io\/> \u2013 \"software is eating law\".\n\nIt's been an intense period of product development, and I'm now writing to follow up.\n\nThe good news: the platform is almost ready for launch. When we announce it, you'll be one of the first to know!\n\nRight now, though, I'd like to better understand your requirements. You see, Legalese tries to serve a range of users, from startups to mature businesses, who need a range of services, from just a simple NDA to an entire sequence of agreements to get them through a fundraising round.\n\nSo I want to make sure that what we're doing will be relevant to you. These are the kinds of questions that are on my mind:\n- Are you preparing for a seed\/angel or Series A round?\n- Have you already retained a lawyer? If not, what's keeping you from using a law firm?\n- Have you found any relevant templates online? Were they satisfactory? Do you plan to use them?\n\nBut rather than ask you all those questions at once, let me just ask you this: what's the biggest difficulty you've encountered in the process so far, and what did you hope Legalese could help you with?\n\nI know that it's been a few weeks since you signed up. If you've found an alternative solution to your problem, and you no longer need Legalese, that's cool \u2026 but can you tell us what you ended up doing?\n\nThanks in advance. You're helping us make the service more useful to you and to other people like you.\n\nWhen you reply, please CC <mailto:active-team@legalese.io|active-team@legalese.io> \u2026 thanks!\n\nregards\nmeng\"",

                "text": "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy may be the most interesting website on the internet. Not because of the content\u2014which includes fascinating entries on everything from ambiguity to zombies\u2014but because of the site itself.\nIts creators have solved one of the internet\u2019s fundamental problems: How to provide authoritative, rigorously accurate knowledge, at no cost to readers. It\u2019s something the encyclopedia, or SEP, has managed to do for two decades.\nThe internet is an information landfill. Somewhere in it\u2014buried under piles of opinion, speculation, and misinformation\u2014is virtually all of human knowledge.\u00a0The story of the SEP shows that it is possible to create a less trashy internet.\u00a0 But sorting through the trash is difficult work. Even when you have something you think is valuable, it often turns out to be a cheap knock-off.\nThe story of how the SEP is run, and how it came to be, shows that it is possible to create a less trashy internet\u2014or at least a less trashy corner of it. A place where actual knowledge is sorted into a neat, separate pile instead of being thrown into the landfill. Where the world can go to learn everything that we know to be true. Something that would make humans a lot smarter than the internet we have today.\nThe impossible trinity of information\nThe online SEP has humble beginnings. Edward Zalta, a philosopher at Stanford\u2019s Center for the Study of Language and Information, launched it way back in September 1995, with just two entries.\nPhilosophizing, pre-internet.(Flickr\/Erik Drost\u2014CC-BY-2.0)\nThat makes it positively ancient in internet years. Even Wikipedia is only 14. Sites that have been around 20 years mostly belong to brands that predate the internet\u2014like Bloomberg or MTV\u2014or they\u2019re old sites that just happen to still work, like the classic Space Jam.\nThe SEP is neither pre-internet, nor is it ossified. It now contains nearly 1,500 entries, and changes are made daily. The site gets over a million page views per month\u2014a respectable number, given how many entries there are with titles like Tibetan epistemology and philosophy of language or Peirce\u2019s theory of signs. The American Library Association\u2019s Booklist review called it \u201ccomparable in scope, depth and authority\u201d to the biggest philosophy encyclopedias in print, the 10-volume offerings from Routledge and Macmillan\u2014and that was nearly a decade ago.\nJohn Perry, the director of the center, was the one who first suggested a dictionary of philosophical terms. But Zalta had bigger ideas. He and two co-authors later described the challenge in a 2002 paper (pdf, p. 1):\nA fundamental problem faced by the general public and the members of an academic discipline in the information age is how to find the most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about an important topic.\nThat paper is so old that it mentions \u201cCD-ROMs\u201d in the second sentence. But for all the years that have passed, the basic problem remains unsolved. \u00a0The requirements are an \u201cimpossible trinity\u201d\u2014like having your cake, eating it, and then bringing it to another party.\u00a0The three requirements the authors list\u2014\u201dauthoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date\u201d\u2014are to information what the \u201cimpossible trinity\u201d is to economics. You can only ever have one or two at once. It is like having your cake, eating it, and then bringing it to another party.\nYet if the goal is to share with people what is true, it is extremely important for a resource to have all of these things. It must be trusted. It must not leave anything out. And it must reflect the latest state of knowledge. Unfortunately, all of the other current ways of designing an encyclopedia very badly fail to meet at least one of these requirements.\nWhere other encyclopedias fall short\nBook\r\nAuthoritative: \u221a\r\nComprehensive: X\r\nUp-to-date: X\nPrinted encyclopedias: still a thing(Princeton University Press)\nPrinted books are authoritative: Readers trust articles they know have been written and edited by experts. Books also produce a coherent overview of a subject, as the editors consider how each entry fits into the whole. But they become obsolete whenever new research comes out. Nor can a book (or even a set of volumes) be comprehensive, except perhaps for a very narrow discipline; there\u2019s simply too much to print.\nCrowdsourcing\r\nAuthoritative: X\r\nComprehensive: X\r\nUp-to-date: \u221a\nA crowdsourced online encyclopedia has the virtue of timeliness. Thanks to Wikipedia\u2019s vibrant community of non-experts, its entries on breaking-news events are often updated as they happen. But except perhaps in a few areas in which enough well-informed people care for errors to get weeded out, Wikipedia is not authoritative. \u00a0Basic mathematics entries on Wikipedia were a \u201ca hot mess of error, arrogance, obscurity, and nonsense.\u201d \u00a0One math professor reviewed basic mathematics entries and found them to be a \u201ca hot mess of error, arrogance, obscurity, and nonsense.\u201d Nor is it comprehensive: Though it has nearly 5 million articles in the English-language version alone, seemingly in every sphere of knowledge, fewer than 10,000 are \u201cA-class\u201d or better, the status awarded to articles considered \u201cessentially complete.\u201d\nSpeaking of holes, the SEP has a rather detailed entry on the topic of holes, and it rather nicely illustrates one of Wikipedia\u2019s key shortcomings. Holes present a tricky philosophical problem, the SEP entry explains: A hole is nothing, but we refer to it as if it were something. (Achille Varzi, the author of the holes entry, was called upon in the US presidential election in 2000 to weigh in on the existential status of hanging chads.) If you ask Wikipedia for holes it gives you the young-adult novel Holes and the band Hole.\nIn other words, holes as philosophical notions are too abstract for a crowdsourced venue that favors clean, factual statements like a novel\u2019s plot or a band\u2019s discography. Wikipedia\u2019s bottom-up model could never produce an entry on holes like the SEP\u2019s.\nCrowdsourcing + voting\r\nAuthoritative: ?\r\nComprehensive: X\r\nUp-to-date: ?\nA variation on the wiki model is question-and-answer sites like Quora (general interest) and StackOverflow (computer programming), on which users can pose questions and write answers. These are slightly more authoritative than Wikipedia, because users also vote answers up or down according to how helpful they find them; and because answers are given by single, specific users, who are encouraged to say why they\u2019re qualified (\u201cI\u2019m a UI designer at Google,\u201d say).\nBut while there are sometimes ways to check people\u2019s accreditation, it\u2019s largely self-reported and unverified. Moreover, these sites are far from comprehensive. Any given answer is only as complete as its writer decides or is able to make it. And the questions asked and answered tend to reflect the interests of the sites\u2019 users, which in both Quora and StackOverflow\u2019s cases skew heavily male, American, and techie.\nMoreover, the sites aren\u2019t up-to-date. While they may respond quickly to new events, answers that become outdated aren\u2019t deleted or changed but stay there, burdening the site with a growing mass of stale information.\nThe Stanford solution\nSo is the impossible trinity just that\u2014impossible? Not according to Zalta. He imagined a different model for the SEP: the \u201cdynamic reference work.\u201d\nDynamic reference work\r\nAuthoritative: \u221a\r\nComprehensive: \u221a\r\nUp-to-date: \u221a\r\n\nTo achieve authority, several dozen subject editors\u2014responsible for broad areas like \u201cancient philosophy\u201d or \u201cformal epistemology\u201d\u2014identify topics in need of coverage, and invite qualified philosophers to write entries on them. If the invitation is accepted, the author sends an outline to the relevant subject editors.\n\u00a0This is not somebody randomly deciding to answer a question on Quora.\u00a0\u201cAn editor works with the author to get an optimal outline before the author begins to write,\u201d says Susanna Siegel, subject editor for philosophy of mind. \u201cSometimes there is a lot of back and forth at this stage.\u201d Editors may also reject entries. Zalta and Uri Nodelman, the SEP\u2019s senior editor, say that this almost never happens. In the rare cases when it does, the reason is usually that an entry is overly biased. In short, this is not somebody randomly deciding to answer a question on Quora.\nAn executive editorial board\u2014Zalta, Nodelman, and Colin Allen\u2014works to make the SEP comprehensive. They steer the encyclopedia away from the \u201cwiki-hole\u201d\u2014having to open endless Wikipedia pages defining jargon in order to understand the topic at hand. \u201cWe tell our authors to try to write an entry that is self-contained,\u201d Nodelman explains.\nEdward Zalta presents the SEP to the 2015 Wikimania conference.(Aasrubio\u2014CC BY-SA 4.0)\nOf course, it\u2019s not just single entries that have to be comprehensive, but the encyclopedia as a whole. The board sees to this too, looking for cases where one long entry should be split up, or where one should absorb another. \u201cWe had an entry on brains in a vat, but that was subsumed by \u2018skepticism and external content,'\u201d Nodelman adds (in easily the most philosophy-department line I\u2019ve heard since earning my bachelor\u2019s degree). Subject editors help with this as well, by identifying areas that deserve more attention and soliciting writers.\nCan something so thorough be up-to-date? The editors have ways to make sure that it is.\nA new entry is expected to contain the freshest possible information and research on a topic. As soon as it is published, the clock starts ticking on a new deadline. In exactly four years\u2014or earlier if research has moved on significantly\u2014the author must again hand in the most up-to-date entry on the topic.\nIn effect, therefore, each entry is on its own publishing schedule. \u201cThis is the only rational way to somehow keep track of all of the arcane topics out there,\u201d adds Zalta. \u201cWe are processing updates and changes daily,\u201d says Nodelman. An ever-changing What\u2019s New page shows the SEP revisions and additions for each day.\nThe ever-changing SEP(SEP)\nUpdates come from a variety of sources. Quartz spoke to several SEP authors and editors, some of whom said that the encyclopedia is used frequently both as a reference and as a teaching tool. This means that philosophers are some of the SEP\u2019s core readers, and they can alert authors or subject editors to incorrect or insufficient entries. Knowledgable readers are encouraged to do the same, even if they\u2019re not philosophers.\nThe fact that there is a specific author and editor, and that the SEP has become so important to philosophy, helps make all of this easier. Any errors reflect poorly on the contributors, and someone who spots a slip-up can talk to a real person about it\u2014neither of which is true with Wikipedia. And if an author is slow or unwilling to respond, the editorial board will transfer his or her responsibilities to a brisker philosopher.\nThe individual can be wiser than the crowd\nThere are a bunch of other benefits to this approach. Chief among them is giving the encyclopedia what Zalta calls an \u201cauthorial voice.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cProfoundly ugly, resembling a satyr more than a man.\u201d\u2014The SEP on Socrates\u00a0After regularly trawling through the internet information trash heap, it\u2019s easy to forget exactly what that means: something written by a professional writer who has deep knowledge of the material at hand and an actual personality.\nAn exemplary SEP entry in this regard is the one on Socrates, written by Debra Nails, a specialist in ancient Greek philosophy. It contains a section called \u201cSocrates\u2019 strangeness\u201d that captures the man in a way that\u2019s much too elegant and confident to be on Quora or Wikipedia.\nThe extant sources agree that Socrates was profoundly ugly, resembling a satyr more than a man\u2014and resembling not at all the statues that turned up later in ancient times and now grace Internet sites and the covers of books. He had wide-set, bulging eyes that darted sideways and enabled him, like a crab, to see not only what was straight ahead, but what was beside him as well; a flat, upturned nose with flaring nostrils; and large fleshy lips like an ass. Socrates let his hair grow long, Spartan-style (even while Athens and Sparta were at war), and went about barefoot and unwashed, carrying a stick and looking arrogant. He didn\u2019t change his clothes but efficiently wore in the daytime what he covered himself with at night.\nJacques Louis David\u2019s The Death of Socrates. An ugly man with an authorial voice.(Public Domain)\nThis authorial voice also avoids the tendency of crowdsourcing to be unhelpfully uncontroversial. For a long time, Wikipedia\u2019s introductory line on Immanuel Kant read that he was \u201ca central figure of modern philosophy.\u201d The SEP, on the other hand, confidently calls him \u201cthe central figure in modern philosophy.\u201d It\u2019s a difference of only one word, but it explains the consensus of the philosophical community and conveys Kant\u2019s true significance. (While I was writing this, Wikipedia updated that line to read \u201cthe central figure,\u201d but quoting and attributing the SEP.)\nAnother benefit of the SEP\u2019s not being crowdsourced is that minority views get more exposure. \u00a0Wikipedia\u2019s overview of feminist philosophy is hopelessly short. The SEP has dozens of meticulously researched entries.\u00a0A 2012 survey by Wikimedia, Wikipedia\u2019s parent organization, found that about 90% of its volunteers were men. \u201cIts entries on Pokemon and female porn stars are comprehensive, but its pages on female novelists or places in sub-Saharan Africa are sketchy,\u201d said the MIT Technology Review in its article The Decline of Wikipedia, which criticizes its byzantine editing hierarchy. The same goes for an important idea in philosophy: feminism. Wikipedia\u2019s overview of feminist philosophy is hopelessly short. The SEP, on the other hand, is home to dozens of meticulously researched entries on the topic.\nSo the SEP model works, and it has 1,500 fact-checked, peer-reviewed entries to prove it.\nWho pays the philosopher?\nYou might think all this can only be possible courtesy of a wealthy patron underwriting generous fees for authors and a large staff of editors. Not at all.\nTo be fair, Stanford does pay most of the operating costs. But the SEP has a paid staff of only three\u2014Zalta, Nodelman, and Allen\u2014plus five other Stanford employees who spend 20% of their time on technical support. Neither the authors, nor the dozens of subject editors, get so much as a dime for their troubles.\n\u00a0Neither the authors, nor the dozens of subject editors, get so much as a dime for their troubles.\u00a0And all the authors and editors I spoke to seemed perfectly happy with this arrangement, even though some entries are a long time in the making. Siegel, the philosophy of mind editor, said that most take at least a few months from start to finish. The longest one she has overseen \u201cstretched out for some years.\u201d\nThere are a few reasons why contributors are willing to put in the time. First, these are already things that they are deeply interested in and enjoy. Peter Adamson, author of the entries on Al-Kindi and the Theology of Aristotle, noted that he had already written books on these topics. Siegel mentioned that being an editor allowed her to \u201ckeep up with interesting segments of the field.\u201d\n\u201cI am very lucky to be able to do philosophy for a living,\u201d writes Adamson, \u201cand I am interested in doing things that would justify why I should be allowed to make a living in this rather nice way, where I am effectively paid to do something that I would do for free, as a hobby.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure more people have read my [SEP] entries on Frege than all my other publications combined.\u201d\u00a0Then there is the fact that the SEP allows academic philosophers to reach a wider audience. This helps them gain recognition and bring ideas they think are important to the world outside universities and conferences.\n\u201cI thought writing this entry would be a good way to bring attention to the many interesting and socially relevant debates that were taking place among feminist philosoph",

        "text": "*More on Axiom's Law contract generation tools for companies*\n\nThe new Axiom Accelerator has been launched to provide a platform for businesses so they can more efficiently and thoroughly execute basic contracts and agreements.\nA business service that supports end-to-end contracting, Accelerator manages the process through the full contract lifecycle.\n\n\u201cAccelerator is intended for simpler, more routine agreements,\u201d Sandy Devine, Axiom\u2019s executive vice president, explained in an interview with Legaltech News.\nWithout such offerings, routine agreements can delay deals, slow down product development and block the progression of business, Devine said.\n\nBut Accelerator lets employees, such as sales staff, select a routine agreement from the tool. If needed, the platform will route the Axiom agreement for review by Axiom attorneys.\nIn addition, it is a self-service model, where companies can pay a monthly fee based on their volume of use.\n\nIt is meant for those enterprises that have at least thousands of agreements a year. Most customers would be medium- or large-sized, or, smaller firms that generate enough contracts.\n\n\u201cThe concept of self service is not new,\u201d Devine said. But Devine said other options \u201ctend to be dead-end streets.\u201d If a clause needs to be negotiated further, other self-service tools \u201ccome to a screeching halt,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Axiom Accelerator provides full policy compliance and transparency. Contracts also can be tracked and managed at appropriate levels.\n\nFrom the point of view of general counsel, \u201cThey want to enable their enterprises,\u201d Devine said. That means making legal work in enterprises faster, simpler and cheaper, she explained. This way, internal legal resources can be redeployed to the most strategic matters.\nThe Accelerator business service features IRIS as the underlying proprietary platform, which Axiom built. It is built on the <http:\/\/Salesforce.com|Salesforce.com> platform and is integrated with DocuSign. They are both cloud-based. This offering, too, is fully hosted in the cloud with appropriate security precautions. And Axiom provides a concierge desk at centers that are brought in when needed if there are legal issues that require a lawyer\u2019s approval.\n\nThe Accelerator platform is the only contracting offering to combine self-service technology with a concierge service that provides access to contract negotiators.\nAxiom Accelerator is suited for such documents as: non-disclosure agreements, sales agreements or software licensing agreements.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers at companies are looking for cost savings and more efficient operations. Accelerator is part of the evolving solution. Instead of using outside law firms for routine contracts, the use of Accelerator can save 50 percent or more.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a big sea-change across the legal services environment right now,\u201d Devine said. \u201cGeneral counsel are looking for ways to enable the business.\u201d\n\n<http:\/\/m.legaltechnews.com\/module\/alm\/app\/ltn.do#!\/article\/1753879587>",

I would argue that we should stay away from the sexy stuff \u2013 because there are a few domains which software hasn't eaten yet, and one of those is programming itself. For the last 50 years people have wanted to build tools to make it easier to program without knowing programming; and that goal remains elusive, if not illusory, because at the end of the day, creating a requirements specification is a design exercise which is fundamentally irreducible. If it is impossible to reduce the essentials of spelling out what you want in software, then it is equally irreducible to spell out what you want in legal. At best we can reduce a coding problem to a configuration problem, but there will always be a desire to tweak the template and add customizations; and those customizations will be in the form of code, not data. This is an insight we borrow from Lisp. For example, adding custom constraints and cases will ultimately involve functions, not just data. In other words, parameterization (limited to simple data types like strings and numbers) will never be expressive enough; we have to intermix code and data.",

The reason why the isomorphism principle is desirable is immediate: (local) changes in the paper contract correspond to (local) changes in the formalized contract (and vice versa), and a formal encoding which is reminiscent of the paper contract, should be easier for domain experts (i.e., lawyers) to maintain.",

                "text": "Recently\u00a0made available\u00a0by Y Combinator, the SAFE investment instrument is intended to improve on the highly\u00a0popular convertible note used by startups during the seed stage or as a short-term bridge between equity rounds.\u00a0 SAFE stands for \u201csimple agreement for future equity\u201d.\u00a0 The purpose of this blog post is to generally review the elements that make up a SAFE investment and compare\u00a0them to a convertible note.\u00a0 For those not already highly familiar with convertible notes, see my blog post title \u201cConvertible Note Basics\u201d for a primer.\nBefore jumping into the review and comparison, I\u2019ll say that I generally like SAFE and would not have a problem investing using it, either\u00a0as an investor or recommending it to a startup I advise.\u00a0 I can\u2019t yet say that I prefer it over a convertible note.\u00a0 Instead, I see both as viable investment instruments for seed stage investing, each with their own pros and cons.\u00a0 I\u2019m not quite sure I like the name because all seed stage investing is highly risky but hopefully accredited investors already know that.\u00a0 Coming up with an acronym for SIMPLE might have been more appropriate but I\u2019m at least happy to see another viable seed stage investment instrument in the market.\n\nSummary\nSAFE is a short, 5-page investment document that is intended to be simple to understand and convenient to administer.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a debt instrument but rather investments via SAFE show up on the company\u2019s capitalization table (cap table) like other convertible securities (ie \u2013 warrants, options).\u00a0 So in this regard, SAFE provides investors the opportunity to convert their investment to equity at a point in the future when an equity round is raised and preferred shares are issued.\u00a0 SAFE has provisions for early exit (change of control) or dissolution of the company and it also has preferential provisions for investors such as discounts and valuation caps.\u00a0 But one thing SAFE doesn\u2019t have is a maturity date (remember, it\u2019s not a debt instrument), so there is a possibility that it never converts to equity and there\u2019s nothing in the terms that call for the investment to be repaid to the investor.\n\u00a0\nComparing SAFE to a Convertible Note\nThe following comparison is written from the Investor\u2019s perspective.\u00a0 Startups will read this with a different lens but I believe their conclusion for most of the categories below will be the same.\nSimplicity\u2013 Both are fairly simple to understand but since SAFE isn\u2019t a debt instrument and since its creators took special care to keep it ultra simple, it literally fits on five pages.\n(Advantage: SAFE)\nConversion to Equity\u2013 Both convert to equity when a future priced\/equity round is closed.\u00a0 However, convertible notes stipulate a minimum amount of money to be raised in a future\u00a0equity round before being considered a \u201cqualifying transaction\u201d that triggers conversion.\u00a0 SAFE investments convert with any amount raised in an equity round, which\u00a0is definitely a simpler approach and something that should appeal to investors since they don\u2019t have to worry if\/when the company will raise enough money to be considered a \u201cqualifying transaction\u201d.\n(Advantage: SAFE)\nDiscount\u2013 Both offer a discount to early\u00a0investors, which is applied to the valuation used during the future equity round.\n(No Advantage)\nValuation Cap\u2013 Both offer the investor the choice of the discounted valuation (using the stated discount) or a pre-negotiated valuation cap, whichever is more favorable at the time of conversion.\u00a0 (See my related\u00a0post titled \u201cJustifying the Cap\u00a0Amount in\u00a0Your Convertible Note\u201c)\n(No Advantage)\nEarly Exit\u2013 Both offer similar payout mechanisms if a change of control event (ie \u2013 acquisition) happens before a natural conversion to equity.\u00a0 Note that the SAFE documents are written\u00a0to give the investor a\u00a0choice of a 1X payout or\u00a0conversion to equity at the cap amount and then participation in the acquisition\u00a0along with other equity holders.\u00a0 Since many convertible notes offer a 2X payout option, this is one thing I expect to see investors negotiate into the SAFE document.\n(No Advantage)\nInterest Rate\u2013 Convertible notes have them since they are debt instruments but SAFEs don\u2019t.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure seed stage investors care much about the interest they accrue on convertible notes, but the truth is a note that carries 6% interest for 18 months before converting can accrue a non-trivial\u00a0amount of interest that\u00a0also converts to equity along with the invested principal.\n(Advantage: Convertible Note)\nMaturity Date (Term) \u2013 Convertible notes have them since they are debt instruments but SAFEs don\u2019t.\u00a0 To evaluate this difference, you have to think about two scenarios.\u00a0 In a case where the company is doing well but just hasn\u2019t needed to raise additional funding as soon as they thought, the company and the investors usually have two choices.\u00a0 They can either\u00a0agree to extend the maturity date on the convertible note\u00a0rather than force a payoff of the note or some convertible notes have an option to convert to equity using the valuation cap amount as the pre-money valuation if the maturity date is reached.\u00a0\u00a0In a case where the company is struggling and likely not going to survive, the convertible note investors can try to force a payoff of the note, but the final result probably isn\u2019t going to be very exciting for either party.\u00a0 Since the SAFE doesn\u2019t have the concept of a maturity date or term, possibly the biggest risk is with\u00a0companies that do so well that they never need to raise an equity round and the SAFE investment never converts naturally.\u00a0 But a well-performing company like this isn\u2019t just going to leave their seed stage investors hanging and surely will figure out a way to convert them to equity \u2013 it\u2019s just not certain at all how fair the investors will feel the terms of conversion are because the company holds all the power in such a negotiation.\n(Advantage: Convertible Note)\nCompany Business Structure\u2013 Often times, companies raising seed stage money are still in LLC formation (rather than a C-corporation).\u00a0 Since a convertible note is a debt instrument, it is usually fine for an LLC to use.\u00a0 However, SAFE appears to require incorporation since the value of the SAFE investment\u00a0is reflected on the cap table like warrants or stock options.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing this could affect 50% or more\u00a0of startups that are still less than $250K in revenue and haven\u2019t otherwise had a reason to convert to a C-corp.\n(Advantage: Convertible Note)\n\nI can\u2019t suggest to simply add up the scoring from my assessment above to determine a \u201cwinner\u201d because each company seeking seed-round\u00a0investment is so different and with many factors playing an influence.\u00a0 So instead, entrepreneurs should assess their current situation, expected future path, and\u00a0investors\u2019 interests and concerns before deciding which instrument is best to use.\u00a0 Having said that, above\u00a0is\u00a0a quick summary graphic based on my\u00a0assessment from an investor\u2019s perspective.\nThere are a couple of other miscellaneous points worth mentioning about SAFE:\n\nThere are questions as to the effect SAFEs will have on the Fair Market Value of the company\u00a0(used to set the current share price).\u00a0 Should raising money via SAFE trigger a 409A valuation or not?\nInterestingly, the sale of Common stock to raise money doesn\u2019t naturally trigger conversion for SAFE investors.\u00a0 This is the same with most convertible notes but they at least have maturity dates that force some sort of action eventually.\nIf the startup does well and never needs to raise money via the sale of Preferred shares, they could start issuing dividend payments to Common shareholders and SAFE investors wouldn\u2019t be entitled to participate in those payments.\nFollowing a conversion to equity, certain rights granted to SAFE investors are based on their original investment amount.\u00a0 This is done\u00a0via a separate series of preferred stock, commonly called \u201cshadow\u201d or \u201csub-series\u201d preferred.\u00a0 The rights affected include the liquidation preference and\u00a0dividend rate.\u00a0 This is necessary due to the discount or if the valuation cap comes into play, both of which give the SAFE investor\u00a0a preferential price per share.\u00a0 This seems fair and isn\u2019t something most convertible notes take into account.\u00a0 But I guess it also complicates things with different classes of preferred shares at such an early stage of the company\u2019s lifecycle.\n\nThe Wilson Sonsini lawyer that created the SAFE instrument, Carolynn Levy, was interviewed roughly a year after the SAFE was introduced to assess the feedback from both startups and investors.\u00a0 You can read the interview here.\nIf you haven\u2019t yet determined the exact

                "text": "\u201cAnd suddenly it\u2019s hard to find the memories you left behind. Remember, do you remember? The laughter and the tears, the shadows of misty yesteryears. The good times and the bad you\u2019ve seen and all the others in between. Remember, do you remember the times of your life?\u201d \u2013 Paul Anka\nBenny and I were driving along Changi wanting to get coffee at The Coastal Settlement. We had forgotten it was a Monday and that TCS was closed. A retro signboard caught my attention and I blurted \u201cWhat\u2019s that? A new place? Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d Benny reversed.\nWe went upslope and wondered if the place was opened for business. To our relief, we saw a few guests dining in the small building. Inside it was d\u00e9ja vu for me! I was quickly transported to my paternal grandma\u2019s house, which was also in Changi, that I used to stay over every school holidays. We had a hen house and fruit orchard in our backyard which this minuscule mansion paled in comparison and remotely resembled but all the same, the feeling is a humbling familiarity which overwhelmed me instantaneously. Since that afternoon, I have brought a number of friends there on several occasions and they all love the rustic decor, the yummy food, the evergreen oldies from tear-jerker Chinese movies (which my aunts would drag me to watch with them in open-air cinemas back then when tickets were about 50 cents) and not to mention that their service is not perfect but still really commendable! You bet I will be back again and again.\nA retro signboard caught my attention and I blurted \u201cWhat\u2019s that? A new place? Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d\nOne of my uncles used to have a car just like this back in the 70s and 8 people were squeezed into it when we went outing.\nValet parking is available on certain days.\nOutside dining available.\nIt\u2019s a nice place to hang out even though there\u2019s not much of a scenic view. If you like oldies, this place reeks nostalgia.\nThis will probably kill me one day (I\u2019m a heavy smoker) but for now this old school ashtray led me to my yesteryears when my grandpapa smoked pipe and my nana smoke \u201cang hoon\u201d (tobacco leaves) which I had to help roll and keep them in a round metal Consulate (a brand of menthol cigarette introduced by Rothmans International) ciggy box. I would be paid 5 cents for my task which is big money during those times, enough to buy a packet of freshly roasted chestnuts.\n\u00a0\nOne of the games we used to play. A piece of chalk, a pebble\/stone in hand and concrete floor were all that\u2019s needed.\nMenu laid on kopitiam marble table at the car porch should the place be filled (while waiting).\nHey hey, that\u2019s a new way to take a selfie!\nYou see anything familiar? If so, I know your age, hahaha\u2026\nEven the ceiling is not spared of oldies paraphernalia.\nPastries and cakes are kept at most for 2 days.\n\u201cI must have this!\u201d I told Benny.\nLooking good but how\u2019s the taste?\nBenny ordered a sarsi float but they didn\u2019t have the one he wanted. He said it wasn\u2019t so great.\nNot too sweet and texture was denser than I\u2019d expected.\nJubilee Horfun is one of their signature dish at $17, it better be good! Yen informed me that they didn\u2019t have mussels for this dish that day but I\u2019ll take it anyway.\nPork Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce.\nChicken Satay $12 Aromatic satay sans the ultra sweetness we usually get from the hawker stalls. Nicely crisp and charred chunks with tender moist insides I\u2019m suspecting only chicken thigh meat can produce such texture.\nCrispy Spring Roll $7 Nothing new but definitely one of the must-try bar snacks which goes very well with ice cold beer.\nBattered Otak Sticks $13 I love Otak (spicy fish paste) and the way this snack is recreated in the form of battered sticks is quite a novelty.\nChicken Wings $10 You can hear the crunch with savoury every bite. A bit dry inside but what would you expect from deep-fried food?\nGrilled Squid Black Pepper $12\nIkan Bilis $9. Ross asked for more chilli padi which set my sore throat on fire that day.\nThe only dish that contained msg is the Ter Kah Beehoon (Vermicelli stewed in canned pork trotters) in the background. Assam Fish with Rice is a new dish on their menu during my 3rd visit.\nAssam Fish Rice $20. The barramundi was a little fishy to me but the gravy was great! The sour in it was just nice I wish there\u2019s more gravy.\nTer Kah Beehoon $15, the only dish that contained msg. I\u2019m quite tolerant of msg having eaten out quite frequently so it didn\u2019t matter. This dish which is moist was quite charming. The omelet strips gave extra texture. Benny loves the cabbage was braised till soft.\nPork Cutlet Curry $18\nBroad rice noodles Horfun here comes with mussels but no egg ribbons. According to Steve who waited on us, this is because Singapore style horfun during the early does not contain egg. Wat dan horfun (\u6ed1\u86cb\u6cb3\u7c89) is Malaysian invention. I didn\u2019t know that!\nFresh Sotong (Squid) is not on the menu and is subject to availability and market price. We paid $20 for this portion on my last visit.\nJust a squeeze of lemon juice and some coarse (sea?) salt and they were heavenly. Benny couldn\u2019t stop raving about it.\nChicken Curry $14, available with baguette or rice.\nBubur Cha Cha $7 \u2013 made with fresh grated coconut milk and not the packaged type. Available hot or cold. Andrew said, \u201cl\u2019ll come back just for this!\u201d After eating this dessert several times, I find that the cooking time varied rendering the sweet potatoes and tapioca cubes not thoroughly cooked on a couple of occasions.\nCheng Tng $7, available hot or cold is a safer bet for me. I asked if they had attap chee (edible seeds of palm) and they had. Attap chee ($1) is not the usual ingredient in cheng tng and I was happy they consented to my request to add them in my dessert.\nTripple shot macchiato and cappuccino.\nLatest visit to Jubilee was on 11th January 2015 with Chisao (holding the selfie stick), Benny, myself, Cynthia and Dominic (owners of Ho Tit Coffee \u597d\u7684\u5496\u5561). If you have noticed, I\u2019ve got a tan from Bali trip in December 2014! I\u2019ll blog about it later.\nPlaying marbles, catching spiders, flying kites and TV programmes in black and white. Those were the days my friend!\nThe only inconvenience is that it is not easily accessible by public transport and even if you have a car, the parking in the building\u2019s compound is rather limited but there\u2019s a huge lot opposite the road.\nJubilee Coffee House &amp; Bar\n580 Netheravon Road.\nSingapore 508516.\nTel: +65 6543 0060\nOpening hours:\nMondays \u2013 Fridays: 10.30am \u2013 12am (Fridays till 1am)\nSaturdays &amp; Eve of Holidays: 9.30am \u2013 1am\nSundays: 9.30am \u2013 10.30pm\nNote: I am sorry I have not been posting of late. There were many interesting events that happened during the last quarter of 2014 and I was too caught up. I\u2019d decided to write on Jubilee Coffee House &amp; Bar as my first official posting for 2015 since Jubilee (with her dream established since 1965) is synonymous for \u201cceremony, commemoration, festival, holiday, recurrence, feast day, red-letter days\u201d all befitting Singapore\u2019s 50th independence anniversary. Thank you for your patience and continuous support for my blog, The Bonding Tool!\nHappy eating and bonding :)\nClick here to read my Ho Tit Coffee Powder Factory.",

AG26 makes things quite clear. \n\nFor eg, if the RCPS is redeemable at the holder's option at a future time, they are classified as a liability, based on FRS 32, because the entity is not able to avoid the obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. If the RCPS include mandatory distribution rights, then they would also a be liability. \n\nIf there's no redemption, which means we are talking about CPS, the next determining factor is on whether distributions are payable at the discretion of the issuer or not. \n\nEssentially, as Chiahli pointed out, one does not look at the financial instrument's legal form, but the substance of the contractual arrangement of the financial instrument (what rights are attached?).",

It's an arrangement that's been used for a long time between law firms.\n\nHowever, there is the Qn of whether in the above scenario, i am giving legal advice to my friend (which is not an issue for a law firm), and the other issue of agent-principal and if my friend is still paying a commission to the law firm, albeit indirectly. So, there are risks for both the law firm, and the referrer. \n\nthose are the two workarounds I'm personally aware of. \n\n",

You are on the right track in asking that qn, because the payment by the company of an investor's legal fees for the investment, would constitute a breach of the prohibition, unless that fell within one of the numerous exceptions within the CA, of which section 76(9)(A) is the most relevant, but that requires not only that the amount of the assistance does not exceed 10% of the total issued share cap of the company and that the company received fair value, but also directors' resos, a notice to the members, solvency statements, and lodgment of the latter two with the registrar. \n\nHowever, in my experience, this is a point that is ignored by both sets of lawyers, and not just for legal fees, but finders' fees, financial due d fees, etc, and it's just put down as \"market practice\". I actually tried knocking back this on the basis that making the company pay for the investors' legal fees constitutes financial assistance, but my client didn't want to pursue the point. \n\nBut then again, the upcoming amendments  to the CA includes an abolition of the prohibition against private companies providing financial assistance for dealings in its own shares (if they aren't subsidiaries of public companies). So, it will soon be a moot point",

The other shareholders needn't sign it because they are receiving a benefit, and aren't giving one. \n\nSome kiasu draughtsmen add the words \"as though he were a party to it from the beginning\" to be even safer.\n\nin the case of a VC coming in as an investor, it and the rest of the syndicate will almost always insist on a new SHA to replace the old.\n\nin which case the issue you mentioned - of one or more minority shareholders refusing to sign the new SHA - even if they don't have enough voting rights to block the investment or money to exercise pre-emotion rights (if any), may arise. A DORA isn't required; a new SHA is. \n\nI think the only time a DORA is required is if a new investor comes in at the FFF round, and there's an SHA, which he\/she is invited to be bound by, in which case he\/she signs the DORA in favour of the other shareholders, but you don't need the existing shareholders to sign it. \n\n",

I just remembered that I encountered this before (long time ago), and gave advice on it, though eventually, that holdout folded. \n\nessentially, you can't force the holdout to sign the new SHA, and it will only bind those who sign it. An agt can confer rights on non-parties, but cannot impose obligations on non-parties. \n\nAnd the old SHA can't be terminated, since you need all parties to agree to terminate it. So, you have a silly situation where there are two SHAs! one between the hold out and the existing shareholders, and one between the new shareholders and the existing shareholders (less the holdout). \n\nMy advice in that situation was to pass a special reso (as the holdout only had 15%) to amend the articles to include relevant provisions of the new SHA (for eg drag along etc) - which would bind the holdout - and to have all the other existing shareholders sign a deed of discharge\/termination to terminate the existing \/ old SHA as among themselves. \n\nBut in the end, the bugger folded, and everyone was happy. hope this helps!",

The Edwin editor makes me cough out blood too. \n\nthen I picked up \"Learn to Program\" by Chris Pine for ruby instead and found that I could finish it in two weeks .... and now I am looking at the Ruby pickaxe. \n\nWhen I was doing the javascript tutorial on codeacademy, i realised that the syntax and logic is very similar to ruby... I guess ruby is universal enough as a starting language?",

George Bernard Shaw said: \u201cWe learn from history that man can never learn anything from history.\u201d\n\nThe more independent steps that are involved in achieving a scenarios, the more opportunities for failure and the less likely it is that the scenario will happen. We often underestimate the number of steps, people, and decisions involved.\n\nAdd to this that _*we often forget that the reliability of a system is a function of the whole system.

Meng, I know you said that the meetings should be anonymised on parties' names for privacy concerns. That is important. But this creates the problems of:\n(1) naming convention - \"CD with VC firm with focus in asia\" or \"CD with VC firm with focus in tech\" is so broad that it could apply to most people.\n(2) searching\n(3) follow-up meetings: i need to search for the previous records if i have a follow up one, and i would want to know the parties' names. I may have met 50 customers this week, but they've only met one legalese person. doesn't make sense if i don't remember their name or their styles, or stuff they've mentioned.  I do this on my own already -- i suppose this is sort of a cop out, but i'm wondering if there's a way to make this part of institutional memory because it \u200b*is*\u200b useful.\n\nThe most obvious solution seems to make the minutes and records a restricted access folder. Any other suggestions?",

Or whether the lawyer churns out 10,000 contracts or 100. Bearing that in mind, their current system is not tailored for a startup like ours where there is scale.

Edmund Bon is a brilliant lawyer, and he has been talking about legal tech for about more than a year now. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Copied from Ji En's email]\n\nDear all\n\nWith the increasing pace of practice and liberalisation of our profession it is time we look at securing ways -- ourselves -- to better compete in the industry. Rising costs is one issue. Especially for smaller firms who make up the majority of the Bar.\n\nSome thinking has gone into this with a group of lawyers and perhaps at this ideation stage, a model akin to a \"barrister's chambers\" in UK where all tenants are self-employed should be considered. The benefits of the chambers model has been reiterated in the Rivlin report recently published, see: <http:\/\/westerncircuit.co.uk\/data\/documents\/Rivlin-Report_Final-March-2015.pdf> -- page 54 onwards on the future of the Bar.\n\nWe will soon have the LLP for law firms once the LPA is amended. We already have partnerships now and this would be tweaked by the LLP model. We have sole proprietors. We have JLVs etc with foreign firms. We have foreign firms akin to barrister's chambers coming in to our shores doing specific type of work (query: unsure if BC is able to regulate the chambers and does DB have jurisdiction). \n\nI think it is high time some sort of discussion around having a \"Chambers\" model as an alternative law firm be looked into. We are having some informal sessions leading to this event on July 11 : <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/398864173632707\/> -- and wish to hear thoughts on this either by email or face-to-fact meetups\/chats or on the ohone. Trying to have feedback whether it will work or it won't, and advantages or disadvantages of this model.\n\nPlease feel free to drop me a line to chat. And if you are free we will be talking about this in-depth on July 11, 10am -- do drop by to share your thoughts.\n\nThank you.\n\n-- \nedmund bon tai soon\nUndiMsia! community mover \nmalaysian centre for constitutionalism &amp; human rights (MCCHR)\naka pusatrakyatlb \ncurrently moving w\/ UndiMsia! \n\n<http:\/\/www.UndiMsia.com|www.UndiMsia.com>\ntwitter &amp; FB | UndiMsia\n... running w\/ LoyarBurok  \ntwitter &amp; FB | LoyarBurok\n\nCapture.

And when I speak with other lawyers, it seems like more and more angels at the seed stage are asking for such Series A type terms. Prior to these 2, I also worked on another similar investment in March.\n\nAnd many non-institutional and newbie angels are not interested at all in SAFEs, KISSes, and other balanced documents\/terms. One of the two investors told me \"even YC is moving away from the SAFE, why are you even talking about it still\" to me, when I asked if he had come across it. \n\nDo you see a lot of such angels, who ask for RCPS, at the seed stage? Is this also because more people are turning to angel investing? ",

It's certainly true that you could say the Christ who said \"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone\" \u2014 that's a wonderful to have said. Anyone who said that would earn a great deal of respect and interest, you'd say that's one of most beautiful phrases ever, ever uttered. But there is no, absolutely no monopoly on beauty and truth in religion, and I suppose one of the reasons that I'm so fond of the Greeks, and one of the reasons that the great radical and poet Shelley wrote his Prometheus Unbound was that he understood that if you were to compare the Genesis myth, which has, which had bedeviled our culture, the Western European culture for a very long time indeed, for two thousand years, it was essentially a myth in which we should be ashamed of ourselves. God says: who told you you were naked? What possible reason have we to believe that we are naked or that if we are naked there is something to be ashamed of, that what we are and what we do is something for which we should ever apologise, we should apologise for our dreams, our impulses, our appetites, our drives, our desires, are not things to apologise for. Our actions sometimes we do apologise for and we excoriate ourselves for and rightly, but that's the Genesis myth. The Greek myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven and who gave to his favourite \u2014 his favourite mortal: man. In other words what the Greeks were saying is that we have divine fire, whatever is divine is in us, as humans. We are as good as the gods. The gods are capricious and mean and foolish and stupid and jealous and rapine and all the things that Greek mythology show us that they are, and that's a much better it seems to me \u2014 and for that the gods punished Prometheus and chained him to the Caucasus and vultures chewed away at his liver everyday as it regrew because he was immortal of course, and Shelley quite rightly understood \u2014 and interestingly his wife of course wrote Frankenstein as the modern Prometheus \u2014 understood that that mythological idea, that champion of a real humanity and a real humanism, as we've come to call it, is we are captains of our soul and masters of our destiny, and that we contain any divine fire that there is, divine fire that is fine and great. I mean it's perfectly obvious that if there were ever a God he has lost all possible taste. You've only got to look \u2014 forget the aggression and unpleasantness of the radical right or the Islamic hordes to the East - the sheer lack of intelligence and insight and ability to express themselves and to enthuse others of the priesthood and the clerisy here, in this country, and indeed in Europe, you know God once had Bach and Michelangelo on his side, he had Mozart, and now who does he have? People with ginger whiskers and tinted spectacles who reduce the glories of theology to a kind of sharing, you know? That's what religion has become, a feeble and anaemic nonsense, because we understood that the fire was within us, it was not in some idol on an altar, whether it was a gold cross or whether it was a Buddha or anything else, that we have it. The fault is in our stars, but also the glory is (correcting himself) in us not in our stars. The glory \u2014 anything \u2014 we take credit for what is great about man and we take blame for what is dreadful about man, we neither grovel or apologise at the feet of a god, or are so infantile as to project the idea that we once had a father as human beings and we therefore should have a divine one too. We have to grow up, which is partly what Christopher was saying.",

                "text": "Today\u2019s WSJ has a book excerpt about the demise of RIM\/Blackberry. It is a fascinating story but also has a core lesson for product managers (including myself) which is the lesson of \u201cdon\u2019t forget all the parts move\u201d.\nWhile hindsight is always 20\/20, when you are faced with a potentially disruptive situation you have to take a step back and revisit nearly all of your assumptions, foundational or peripheral, because whether you see it or not, they are all going to face intense reinvention.\nIn disruptive theory we always talk about the core concept that disruptive products are better in some things but worse in many of the things (tasks, use cases, features) that are currently in use by the incumbent product. This is the basis of the disruption itself. In reading the excerpt it is clear that out of the gate this reality was how the RIM executives chose to view the iPhone as introduced as targeting a different market segment or different use cases:\nIf the iPhone gained traction, RIM\u2019s senior executives believed, it would be with consumers who cared more about YouTube and other Internet escapes than efficiency and security. RIM\u2019s core business customers valued BlackBerry\u2019s secure and efficient communication systems. Offering mobile access to broader Internet content, says Mr. Conlee, \u201cwas not a space where we parked our business.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a natural business reaction to want to see a new entrant through the lens of a subset of your existing market. Once you can do that you get more comfortable doing battle in a small way rather than head-on.\u00a0 You feel your market size will trump a \u201cniche\u201d player.\nThe problem is that such perspective assumes a static view of the market. You\u2019re assuming that all the other attributes of your implementation will remain advantaged and the new competitor will fail to translate that single advantage into a broader attack.\nWhat happens, almost all the time, in technology is that disruptive entrants gain ecosystem momentum. There\u2019s a finite bandwidth in the best people (engineers, partners, channel) to improve, integrate, promote products. Once the new product appears compelling in some way then there\u2019s a race to gain a perceived first mover advantage. Or said another way, the leaders of the old world were already established and so a new platform yields a new chance to a leader. There\u2019s a mad dash to execute whether you\u2019re building leather cases, integrating line of business systems, or selling the product.\nWhen I read that first quote, I thought how crazy to think that the rest of the internet, which includes email and messaging, would not race to try to establish new leadership in the space. The assumption that everyone is sitting still is flawed. Or just as likely, many of those incumbents will choose to assume their small part of the blackberry world will move ahead unscathed.\nIn a platform transition, everything is up for grabs. If you\u2019re the platform you have to change everything and not just a few little things. First, no matter what you do the change is still going to happen. It means that you don\u2019t have the option of doing nothing. Once a new platform gains momentum and you start losing your partners (of all kinds) or can no longer attract the top talent to the platform you have seen the warning sign and so has everyone else.\nAs Blackberry learned, you can\u2019t take the path of trying to just change a few things and hope that taking what you perceive as the one missing piece and adding it to your platform will make the competitor go away. You can see how this worked in the example of the Storm device introduction, which aimed to add a bigger screen while maintaining the Blackberry keyboard feel. In other words, the perception was that it was the screen that was the thing that differentiated the device.\nThe browser was painfully slow, the clickable screen didn\u2019t respond well in the corners and the device often froze and reset. Like most tech companies launching a glitchy product, RIM played for time. Verizon stoked sales with heavy subsidies, while RIM\u2019s engineers raced to introduce software upgrades to eliminate Storm\u2019s many bugs. \u201cIt was the best-selling initial product we ever had,\u201d says Mr. Lazaridis, with 1 million devices sold in the first two months. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet demand.\u201d\nStorm\u2019s success was fleeting. By the time Mr. Balsillie was summoned to Verizon\u2019s Basking Ridge, N.J., headquarters in the spring of 2009 to review the carrier\u2019s sales data, RIM\u2019s senior executives knew Storm was a wipeout. Virtually every one of the 1 million Storm phones shipped in 2008 needed replacing, Verizon\u2019s chief marketing officer, John Stratton, told Mr. Balsillie. Many of the replacements were being returned as well. Storm was a complete failure, and Mr. Stratton wanted RIM to pay.\nOf course we know now that there were many more elements of the iPhone that changed and it was no single feature or attribute. Every platform shift involves two steps:\n\nIntroduction of a new platform that does some new things but does many existing things in a suboptimal way.\nEvolution of the new platform to achieve all those old scenarios but in new ways that often look like \u201chey we had that back then\u201d.\u00a0 For example, consider the rise of secure messaging, mobile device management, and new implementations of email. All of these could be viewed as \u201cBlackberry features\u201d just done in a totally different way.\n\nThat\u2019s why all the parts are moving, because everything you ever did will get revisited in a new context with a new implementation even if it (a) means the use case goes unanswered for a while and (b) the execution ends up being slightly different.\nOn a personal note, I was a Blackberry user from the earliest days (because our team made Outlook and the initial Blackberry was a client-side integration). When I saw the iPhone I was one of those people fixated on the keyboard. I was certain it would fail because I couldn\u2019t peck out emails as fast as I could on Blackberry. In fact, I even remember talking about how Windows phones at the time had touchscreens so if that became popular we would have that as well.\u00a0 That summer, I waited on line to pick up my iPhone and was convinced of the future in just a few minutes.\nYou would have thought I learned my lesson but previously I was still not convinced of the utility of the internet on a phone. Of course my lens was clouded by the execution of the phones I used most (Blackberry and Windows) and the fact that the internet didn\u2019t want to work on small screens and without Flash.\u00a0 I would visit Japan several times a year and see the DoCoMo i-mode phones and was a big skeptic\u2014my friends from Japan still make fun of me for not seeing the future. What I failed to recognize was that in that implementation a full ecosystem solved the problem by moving all the parts around. Of course i-mode got disrupted when the whole of the internet moved to mobile. So perhaps it wasn\u2019t just me. No matter what happens, someone always said it would. But saying it would happen and acting are very different things. Though I do recall\u00a0many exchanges with Blackberry execs trying to convince them to have a great browser once I used the iPhone.\nThe lesson always comes back to underestimating the power of ecosystem momentum and the desire and ability of new players to do new things on a new platform.\nA while back I made a list of all the moving parts of the Blackberry collapse. You can read it here, Disruption and woulda, coulda, shoulda.\n\u2014Steven Sinofsky (@stevesi)",

I think there will be revenue opportunities in the provision of boring services, like: we automatically extract the deliverables from your contract, and insert them into your calendaring system and your task management project management software.\n\nthe BHAG is to make a dollar every time anyone in the world executes a contract,\nthe same way that Uber wants to make a dollar every time anyone goes from A to B,\nthe same way that Opentable wants to make a dollar every time anyone makes a restaurant reservation.\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nwhat are you using to manage contracts at Proteus?",

                "text": "Crowdfunding just got a little bit more interesting. According to SEC Regulation A+, as of today companies can secure funding via crowdfunding provided they are compliant with a set of very specific laws and standards.\n\u201cThese new rules provide an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections,\u201d said SEC Chair Mary Jo White in a release dated March 25, 2015.  \u201cIt is important for the Commission to continue to look for ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies.\u201d\nAccording to the SEC there are two tiers to the new regulation: Tier 1 \u201cfor offerings of securities of up to $20 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $6 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer\u201d and Tier 2 \u201cfor offerings of securities of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer.\u201d Both require similar requirements but Tier 2 investment requires further disclosure.\nSlava Rubin, CEO of Indiegogo, has been watching the regulation for while and is excited about the possibilities. \n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the SEC\u2019s new equity crowdfunding regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey enable startups and small businesses to secure additional funding, while providing strong investor protection. We will continue to explore how equity crowdfunding may play a role in our business model.\u201d\nHow does the system work? After doing due diligence with a securities attorney this new regulation allows you to \u201ctest\u201d the equity sale by running a Kickstarter-like campaign. This allows potential investors to express interest but not purchase the securities \u2013 in short you\u2019re gathering a mailing list of potential small investors. Once you\u2019ve collected the list you can begin to sell the equity to those investors using a licensed broker dealer.\nBecause you\u2019re not actually selling during your campaign this is a sort of Kickstarter-lite \u2013 it allows you to get the word out and drum up interest while keeping on the right side of the law. A clever marketer, however, can see the intrinsic value of this play.\nSimilar regulations are in the works in the UK and Europe and it will fascinating to watch how companies begin using this equity crowdfunding to bypass the world of standard investment. You can read the entire SEC release below.\n\n\nFACT SHEET\nRegulation A+\nSEC Open Meeting\nMarch 25, 2015\nHighlights of the Final Rules\nThe final rules, often referred to as Regulation A+, would implement Title IV of the JOBS Act and provide for two tiers of offerings:\nTier 1, which would consist of securities offerings of up to $20 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $6 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer.\nTier 2, which would consist of securities offerings of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer.\nIn addition to the limits on secondary sales by affiliates, the rules also limit sales by all selling security-holders to no more than 30 percent of a particular offering in the issuer\u2019s initial Regulation A offering and subsequent Regulation A offerings for the first 12 months following the initial offering.\nFor offerings of up to $20 million, the issuer could elect whether to proceed under Tier 1 or Tier 2.  Both tiers would be subject to basic requirements as to issuer eligibility, disclosure, and other matters, drawn from the current provisions of Regulation A.  Both tiers would also permit companies to submit draft offering statements for non\u2011public review by Commission staff before filing, permit the continued use of solicitation materials after filing the offering statement, require the electronic filing of offering materials and otherwise align Regulation A with current practice for registered offerings.\nAdditional Tier 2 Requirements\nIn addition to these basic requirements, companies conducting Tier 2 offerings would be subject to other requirements, including:\nA requirement to provide audited financial statements.\nA requirement to file annual, semiannual and current event reports.\nA limitation on the amount of securities non-accredited investors can purchase in a Tier 2 offering of no more than 10 percent of the greater of the investor\u2019s annual income or net worth.\nThe staff would also conduct a study and submit a report to the Commission on the impact of both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings on capital formation and investor protection no later than five years following the adoption of the amendments to Regulation A.\nThe Commission is exploring ways to further collaborate with state regulators, including a program for a representative of NASAA or a state securities regulator to work with the staff in the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance in implementing these rules.\nEligibility\nThe exemption would be limited to companies organized in and with their principal place of business in the United States or Canada.  The exemption would not be available to companies that:\nAre already SEC reporting companies and certain investment companies.\nHave no specific business plan or purpose or have indicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company.\nAre seeking to offer and sell asset-backed securities or fractional undivided interests in oil, gas or other mineral rights.\nHave been subject to any order of the Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(j) entered within the past five years.\nHave not filed ongoing reports required by the rules during the preceding two years.\nAre disqualified under the \u201cbad actor\u201d disqualification rules.\nThe rules exempt securities in a Tier 2 offering from the mandatory registration requirements of Exchange Act Section 12(g) if the issuer meets all of the following conditions:\nEngages services from a transfer agent registered with the Commission.\nRemains subject to a Tier 2 reporting obligation.\nIs current in its annual and semiannual reporting at fiscal year-end.\nHas a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed semiannual period, or, in the absence of a public float, had annual revenues of less than $50 million as of its most recently completed fiscal year.\nAn issuer that exceeds the dollar and Section 12(g) registration thresholds would have a two-year transition period before it must register its class of securities, provided it timely files all of its ongoing reports required under Regulation A. \nPreemption of Blue Sky Law\nIn light of the total package of investor protections included in amended Regulation A, the rules provide for the preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements for securities offered or sold to \u201cqualified purchasers,\u201d defined to be any person to whom securities are offered or sold under a Tier 2 offering.\nBackground\nUnder the Securities Act of 1933, when a company offers or sells securities to potential investors, it must either register the offer and sale or rely on an exemption from registration.  Regulation A is a longstanding exemption from registration that permits unregistered public offerings of up to $5 million of securities in any 12-month period, including no more than $1.5 million of securities offered by security-holders of the company.  In recent years, Regulation A offerings have been relatively rare in comparison to offerings conducted in reliance on other Securities Act exemptions or on a registered basis. \nThe JOBS Act amended the Securities Act to require the Commission to update and expand the Regulation A exemption.  In particular, the JOBS Act directed the Commission to:\nAdopt rules that would allow offerings of up to $50 million of securities within a 12-month period.\nRequire companies conducting such offerings to file annual audited financial statements with the SEC.\nAdopt additional requirements and conditions that the Commission determines necessary.\nEffective Date for Regulation A+\nThe rule amendments become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.\ufffc",

Unfortunately, unless you were already very wealthy, securities laws would have prevented you from being able to invest in the these companies.\nEarly adopters have historically been prevented from crossing the threshold from customer to investor. However, a fundamental shift in the relationship between consumers and companies has been set in motion by new SEC regulations set to go into effect on June 19th.\nMost early adopters interested in supporting private companies have been limited to rewards-based crowdfunding. This type of crowdfunding has proven to be a poor substitute for true early stage investing. Rewards-based crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter allow individuals to pre-order products or donate towards something that they want to exist in the world. These \u201cbackers\u201d do not get shares or equity in the company. Although these backers take on significant risk, they do not get any significant upside.\nThe story of Oculus VR is apt. Nearly two years after its celebrated rewards-based crowdfunding raise, Oculus was acquired by Facebook for $2B. Oculus\u2019 early Kickstarter backers felt angered and betrayed. Though they had a sense of ownership in the company, they reaped no benefits from the transaction.

It's still practiced as an artisan craft, not a business process. Nobody has agreed on standards. Most contracts are done without a backend, so there is a lot of cut-and-pasting of names, tables, lists, signature blocks, dates, and spreadsheet calculations, which generates errors and a high copyediting and fact checking overhead. It would take a considerable investment and patience to set up more efficient systems, and lawyers get paid for production and revenue generation, not investment in firm technology.",

                "text": "Last year, I posted data about which majors as law school applicants and matriculants had the best LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs. I have a new data set for the 2013-2014 admissions cycle. (I also have been working with D3, a JavaScript library, to make my graphics more interesting. I'm new to this, but I hope I've avoided any technological glitches!) One cannot identify causation based upon these scores. Students self-identify majors, sometimes more than one, or sometimes none at all; others self-select into taking the LSAT altogether (opting for medical school, business school, or a lucrative career instead of law school). Therefore, it is emphatically not necessarily the case, based on this data, that these majors cause students to perform better or worse on the LSAT. It simply describes them. The chart above identifies the mean highest LSAT score and mean undergraduate GPA based on self-identified major, for majors with at least 80 students taking the exam, among all law school applicants. A forthcoming chart will have the same information, but solely for law school matriculants; that is, for people who actually matriculated to law school this year. Stay tuned! UPDATE: I had some glitches in the first post, so I removed the matriculant data and will save it for another post. The matriculant data is now available here.",

                "text": "Legal documents. If they didn\u2019t already bore you to death imagine having to find the mistakes in them. This is the role of quite a number of poor humans who must screen these things, or suffer hefty losses when something goes wrong.\nFor years, software engineers have enjoyed the assistance of quality assurance software when writing computer code. Lawyers, however, are generally stuck with Microsoft Word. Yikes! So automated, intelligent reviewing of legal contracts by software should be the future. That\u2019s where jEugene, a new YC startup as part of this summer\u2019s batch, comes in.\nThis startup helps the drafters of legal documents catch mistakes that could be fatal to such documents\u2019 validity or enforceability.\nThe original idea of Harry Zhou, who, as a first-year lawyer, was tasked with proofing a 250-page contract and wanted more than his supervising lawyer\u2019s assurance that \u201cyou did great,\u201d jEugene scans through a legal document and highlights in text potential drafting mistakes in the document.\nThe product is being used by White &amp; Case LLP and is undergoing trial at Fenwick &amp; West LLP. Tens of smaller law firms are accessing jEugene through Clio, a provider of cloud-based legal management software. Other clients are under NDA.\nErrors that jEugene currently detects may seem innocuous at times, but could lead to hefty costs. For example, millions of dollars that certain creditors recently failed to recover in a famous bankruptcy case could have been avoided had jEugene been used; and jEugene\u2019s analysis of legal documents disclosed on SEC EDGAR routinely reveals similar errors missed by some of the most sophisticated law firms (they say).\nHere\u2019s how it works: A user uploads a document, waits a few seconds, and downloads the resulting file. This emulates handwritten markups that lawyers are used to seeing, and highlights potential drafting mistakes in the document with different colors. The user then reviews the results to determine whether any revision is necessary.\nCompetitors are software companies that make legal proofreading plugins for Microsoft Word, like Lexus Nexis, but as you can imaging this is pretty old-fashioned. Instead, jEugene runs as a web application, which can be deployed either in a private cloud or as an on-site deployment.\nBecause it\u2019s web architecture, it can perform more sophisticated analysis on legal documents and contribute to a better user experience. In other words, jEugene simply generates better results and won\u2019t slow down or render users\u2019 computers unstable.\nThey plan to make money via a subscription fee per active user. The exact price depends on the number of active users from a subscriber, and whether the charge occurs monthly or annually.\nAt this point it doesn\u2019t use AI, but could in the future.",

The ETA, enacted in July 1998 and re-enacted in 2010, states that digital signatures will be given legal recognition. *_The ETA also provides for an accreditation scheme for CAs - where the digital certificates issued by accredited CAs are automatically accorded validity in court, unless proven otherwise._* Many other countries have also enacted laws to recognise digital signatures. Some of these countries are Germany, Italy, USA and Malaysia.",

Digital signatures are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology, and guarantee signer identity and intent, data integrity, and the non-repudiation of signed documents. The digital signature cannot be copied, tampered with or altered. In addition, because digital signatures are based on standard PKI technology, they can be validated by anyone without the need for proprietary verification software. On the other hand, an electronic signature is a proprietary format (there is no standard for electronic signatures) that may be a digitized image of a handwritten signature, a symbol, voiceprint, etc., used to identify the author(s) of an electronic message. An electronic signature is vulnerable to copying and tampering, and invites forgery. In many cases, electronic signatures are not legally binding and will require proprietary software to validate the e-signature.\"",

In APAC for example,  SG and Malaysia are clear adopters of e signatures -- they set out what are the criteria for non-traditional signatures to be recognised (e.g. verification, reliability). Other jurisdictions like HK have vague case law or regulations recognising them, but don't have anything codified or clearly set out, like in a statute. \n\nDigital signatures is the *actual technology* you use to support your assertion that the signature ought to qualify as a legal signature signifying intent. In Singapore, for example, having digital signatures (the encryption requirements are set out) is one of the ways to show a valid signature.",
